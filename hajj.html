          <h2>Introduction to Hajj</h2>
          <p>
            Hajj, the fifth and final pillar of Islam, represents a pinnacle of
            spiritual devotion and unity among Muslims worldwide. This sacred
            pilgrimage is a mandatory act of worship for every able-bodied and
            financially capable Muslim, symbolizing a profound journey of faith
            and submission to Allah. Occurring during the Islamic month of Dhu
            al-Hijjah, Hajj retraces the footsteps of the Prophet Ibrahim
            (Abraham) and his family, embodying the legacy of steadfastness,
            sacrifice, and obedience to the divine command. Pilgrims, dressed in
            seamless white garments, embark on a transformative odyssey that
            includes symbolic rituals such as Tawaf (circumambulation) around
            the Kaaba, standing in deep contemplation at the vast plain of
            Arafat, and casting stones at symbolic pillars. The simplicity of
            attire reflects the equality of all before Allah, erasing
            distinctions of wealth, race, and nationality. The communal nature
            of Hajj reinforces the unity of the Muslim ummah, as millions
            converge with a shared purpose, transcending cultural and linguistic
            boundaries. This spiritual journey, requiring patience, humility,
            and resilience, serves as a purification of the soul, leaving
            pilgrims with a renewed sense of purpose and a profound connection
            to the universal principles of Islam. The climactic celebration of
            Eid al-Adha, the Festival of Sacrifice, underscores the narrative of
            Ibrahim's unwavering devotion and Allah's mercy. Hajj, with its
            rituals and shared experiences, not only solidifies individual faith
            but fosters a sense of global Islamic brotherhood and sisterhood. It
            stands as a testament to the timeless resilience of the Muslim
            community, echoing the words of Ibrahim and his family as they
            responded to the divine call. In essence, Hajj is a transformative
            and unifying journey that binds Muslims to their shared history,
            strengthens their connection with Allah, and reinforces the
            universal values of submission, sacrifice, and unity.

        <div id="general-content">
          <h3>The Call of Ibrahim (Abraham):</h3>  
          <p>
            
            Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) narrated the words of Ibrahim:
            "O people! Allah has prescribed Hajj upon you, so perform Hajj."
            (Sahih Muslim).
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="general-content">
          <h3>On the Equality of Pilgrims:</h3>
          <p>
            
            The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "O people! Your Lord is one,
            and your father (Adam) is one. There is no preference for an Arab
            over a non-Arab, nor for a non-Arab over an Arab. Neither is the
            white superior to the black nor is the black superior to the white
            except by piety." (Musnad Ahmad).

        <div id="general-content">  
          <h3>The Reward of an Accepted Hajj:</h3>
          <p>
            
            Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever performs Hajj
            and does not commit any obscenity or transgression will return free
            from sins as on the day his mother bore him." (Sahih al-Bukhari,
            Sahih Muslim).
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="general-content"> 
          <h3>On the Day of Arafat:</h3>
          <p>
            
            The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "There is no day on which
            Allah frees more people from the Fire than the Day of Arafat. He
            comes close and expresses His pride to the angels, saying, 'What do
            these people want?'" (Sahih Muslim).
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="general-content">
          <h3>The Importance of Intention:</h3>  
          <p>
            
            Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: "Actions are but by
            intention, and every man shall have only that which he intended.
            Thus, he whose migration was for Allah and His messenger, his
            migration was for Allah and His messenger; and he whose migration
            was to achieve some worldly benefit or to take some woman in
            marriage, his migration was for that for which he migrated." (Sahih
            al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim).

            These Hadiths highlight the obligation of Hajj, the emphasis on
            equality among pilgrims, the immense spiritual reward for a sincere
            and sin-free pilgrimage, the significance of the Day of Arafat, and
            the paramount importance of intention in all actions, including
            Hajj. They collectively underscore the profound spiritual and
            communal aspects of the pilgrimage.
