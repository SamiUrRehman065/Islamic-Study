                <h2>Introduction to Salah</h2>
                <p>Salah, or Salat, stands as a cornerstone of Islamic worship, constituting the second of the Five Pillars of Islam. It is a ritual prayer performed by Muslims five times a day at designated intervals: Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Isha. Serving as a profound means of spiritual connection, Salah provides a structured opportunity for Muslims to commune with Allah, seek guidance, and express gratitude. Before engaging in this act of worship, individuals perform ablution (wudu), emphasizing physical and spiritual purity. Each prayer consists of a set number of units (rak'ahs) with specific postures—standing, bowing, prostrating, and sitting—accompanied by the recitation of verses and chapters from the Quran. The worshipper faces the Kaaba in Mecca, known as the Qiblah, symbolizing unity in worship. Intentions (Niyyah) play a pivotal role, requiring a sincere commitment to pray solely for the sake of Allah. Salah also encompasses community prayers (Jama'ah), fostering a sense of collective worship and unity. Moreover, it encourages the supplication (Dua) for personal needs, seeking Allah's help, forgiveness, and guidance. Beyond its spiritual significance, Salah instills discipline and time management in a Muslim's daily life, contributing to a constant awareness of the divine presence and a commitment to self-discipline. In essence, Salah is a comprehensive act of worship, blending physical movements, Quranic recitations, spiritual contemplation, and community engagement, serving as a vital aspect of a Muslim's spiritual journey..</p>

                    Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: "The first thing for which a person will be brought to account on the Day of Resurrection will be his Salah. If it is found to be perfect, he will be safe and successful. But if it is incomplete, he will be questioned: 'Is there any extra (voluntary) Salah in your record?' If there are any extra prayers, Allah will say: 'Complete the obligatory ones with the voluntary ones.'" (Sunan an-Nasa'i)</p>
