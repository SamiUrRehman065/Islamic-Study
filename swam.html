                <h2>Introduction to Sawm</h2>
                <p>Sawm, or fasting, constitutes the fourth pillar of Islam and is observed by Muslims during the month of Ramadan. This sacred month holds special significance as it marks the period during which the first verses of the Quran were revealed to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Fasting during Ramadan is a rigorous and holistic act of worship that extends beyond abstaining from food and drink. It encompasses refraining from negative behaviors such as gossip, anger, and impatience. Muslims engage in a pre-dawn meal, Suhoor, and conclude their fast with Iftar at sunset. The act of fasting serves as a spiritual and physical discipline, fostering self-control, empathy for the less fortunate, and a heightened awareness of God's presence. Additionally, it offers an opportunity for increased prayer, reflection, and acts of charity. The end of Ramadan is celebrated with the joyous festival of Eid al-Fitr, during which Muslims express gratitude to Allah for the strength and perseverance demonstrated during the month of fasting. In essence, Sawm is a deeply transformative and communal experience that strengthens the individual's connection with Allah and reinforces a sense of shared responsibility and empathy within the global Muslim community..</p>
