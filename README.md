# 🌍 Islam World — My First Semester Web Project

**Live Site:** [Visit on Vercel](https://islamic-study.vercel.app)  

## 📌 Project Overview

**Islam World** is a multi-page educational website that introduces the foundational pillars and teachings of Islam. Built in just 2–3 days during my first semester, this project marks my entry into real-world web development. It combines semantic HTML, modular CSS, and basic JavaScript to deliver a clean, responsive, and informative experience.

The site is designed to be both spiritually respectful and technically structured — offering visitors a guided journey through key Islamic concepts such as Shahada, Salah, Sawm, Zakat, and Hajj, along with articles, events, and a contact form.

- **CSS3** — Custom styling with class-based modularity
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** — Navigation toggle and active page highlighting
