                <h2>Introduction to Zakat</h2>
                <p>Zakat, positioned as the third pillar of Islam, holds a paramount role in shaping the ethical and communal dimensions of a Muslim's life. It is a mandatory form of charitable giving, marking an essential component of the religion's framework. Much like Salah, Zakat is a vehicle through which individuals contribute to the collective welfare and social fabric of the Muslim community. An annual obligation, Zakat entails allocating 2.5% of one's accumulated wealth to specific beneficiaries, including the poor, needy, debtors, wayfarers, and those engaged in Zakat administration. Beyond its financial implications, Zakat functions as a mechanism for wealth purification, recognizing that material prosperity is a divine trust. At its core, Zakat is a manifestation of economic justice, aiming to narrow societal disparities, foster social equality, and secure the holistic well-being of the community.<br>

                    This obligatory act of charity goes beyond the material realm, resonating with spiritual principles. By acknowledging the interconnectedness of wealth and societal harmony, Zakat becomes a tangible expression of communal responsibility and compassion. Its impact extends to the very essence of a Muslim's faith, embodying the principles of social welfare and collective well-being. In aligning with the tenets of intention and sincerity (Niyyah), giving Zakat is not merely a financial transaction but a conscientious act driven by the genuine desire to fulfill religious duties and provide support to those facing economic challenges.<br>
                    
                    Much like the disciplined practice of Salah, Zakat reinforces the importance of community cohesion, shared responsibilities, and a profound sense of empathy. It underscores the interconnectedness of individual and communal destinies, reflecting the broader Islamic ethos that encourages Muslims to actively engage in acts of charity, embodying the values of justice, compassion, and solidarity. In essence, Zakat serves as a beacon guiding Muslims toward a path of responsible stewardship, acknowledging the divine trust vested in their material wealth and fostering a community where the principles of social justice and collective well-being thrive.</p>

Whenever it cools down, (the process is) repeated during a day the extent of which will be fifty thousand years until judgment is pronounced among servants." (Sunan Ibn Majah).</p>
